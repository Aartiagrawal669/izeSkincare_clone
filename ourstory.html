                <div class="p"><p>Stop wasting time on your skincare routine. izé skincare is a company that is never going to convince you to buy anything you don't need. One that is never going to have a 10 product routine, but only a couple simple products you can use daily. A brand where you can recognize every single ingredient. A brand that doesn’t just call itself “sustainable” but actually is. A brand that was started by someone like you and me. A brand that is never going to pay anyone to tell you to “swipe up” on something they didn’t actually use. From seed to bottle, we say what we do, and do what we say.</p></div>

Our shipping boxes and product boxes are all made from 100% recycled cardboard. We do not use any colored ink of foils on our packaging (did you know a lot of skincare brands use inks and other decorative materials on their packaging which affects its recyclability?). We also do not use any plastic besides the dropper portion of our bottle. Unfortunately, there still isn't a good solution to replace plastic droppers. We are working on it! We donate 1% of sales to environmental causes. We only work with certified green vendors.</p></div>

                <div class="p"><p>Some of my earliest memories are sitting on the bathroom floor watching my french mother do her skincare routine. A routine that hasn't changed in 45 years. A three-step routine consisting of: baby oil to remove makeup followed by a homemade rose water potion and topped off by a thick, vaseline-like night cream that smelled like fresh herbs and flowers. That’s it. Her skin: flawless. From an early age I knew I wanted to work in the wellness industry because I saw how much my mom loved her self-care ritual. Her nighttime routine was sacred to her and made her so happy after a long stressful day of working and being a mom. From a young age I knew I wanted to be in an industry that made women feel good about themselves. So at 20 years old, I moved from San Francisco to New York City and started working in marketing & PR for leading skincare companies from all over the world. Name a top skincare brand and I had probably worked with them. My dream career! Little did I know… .</p></div>
